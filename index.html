It is now widely believed that the fourth industrial revolution will be driven by data. Blockchain technology, which makes data self-aware, has become a new asset class. The data of today&rsquo;s world is already large enough to increase the digital dependence of humans and thus generate more data. So the world is scrambling to regulate the use, storage and privacy of data. The data DAO is born from this. Data DAOs represent a post-industrial opportunity.</p>

    <p>Metagovernance refers to the decentralized decision-making organisation exercised certain control by the fragmented and modular interactive governance model. The reason why I think the era of DeFi2.0 is far away is that the definition of DeFi2.0 should not be limited to a simple nested combination of revenue products. The true use case DeFi2.0 would be to transfer the benefits of liquidity from the token staking incentive model to the broader metagovernance.</p>

    <p>The lifeline of the asset management agreement is determined by its overhead. For the Protocol to be sustainable in the long term, DeSyn Protocol needs to obtain sustainable fees from user adoption. Has the DeSyn Protocol done enough to ensure its success? To answer this question, we need to fully understand how the DeSyn Protocol has evolved. This article will describe the state of DeSyn Protocol mobility and the reasons for promoting the use of this asset management Protocol.</p>

    <p>NFTS make our digital lives more virtual and allow us to accomplish everything in the virtual world that we can&rsquo;t do in real life. The next-generation public Aura Network incorporates digital experiences to enable a rich, real-time, globally connected virtual environment that provides a new underlying environment for users to work, play, collaborate, and socialize in a whole new way. The market currently needs a decentralized underlying infrastructure that can meet the needs of complex NFT applications, and Aura Network is designed as a creative platform.</p>

    <p>With the success of Ethereum&rsquo;s Merge, Staking is Staking in a POS network from POW to POS, and Staking is Staking in a POS network, where Staking is Staking in the security of the network by Staking a token in the network. However, an asset that is otherwise locked cannot be used within a certain period of time. However, a derivative Staking frees up the liquidity of an asset, boosting its utilization.</p>

A sufficiently decentralized network must be one where users can communicate with each other anytime, anywhere, in real time, which means that censorship resistance and security are at the core of the network. At the same time, users must have complete control over their identity (username), data (messages) and social graph (relationships with others). If a third party controls either, they can prevent the two users from communicating. Developers must also be free to build applications with unrestricted access to the network.</p>

    <p>We can get away from the virtual space, but we will never get away from the social. The Web3 social circle is expanding, and the integration with the Web2 social model is accelerating, and one or more global distributed social networks that are more resistant to censorship can be expected. At that point, more value elements will be released in this vast network, and the crypto world will no longer be a marginal cultural region.</p>

    <p>Ethereum and Cosmos have always had a huge number of developers and users, but there has been a lack of a project that really brings the two together. Kava, a highly secure, lightening fast Layer 1 blockchain, combines the two most commonly used permissionless execution environments into a single, scalable, developer-optimized network. It has successfully built a bridge between Ethereum and Cosmos, the world&rsquo;s two largest blockchain developer communities. It will also open up endless possibilities for Ethereum and Cosmos.</p>

    <p>With the rapid growth of Ethereum, the proliferation of on-chain businesses has also caused the blockchain network to be overloaded, and on-chain transactions to become slow and expensive. The Defi midsummer in 2020 and the NFT frenzy last year further exacerbated the congestion level of the Ethereum network and severely limited the large-scale development of the ecosystem on the Ethereum chain. Based on this, the expansion of Ethereum has always been concerned by the market, and Rollup expansion technology is the most popular two-layer expansion scheme in the market.</p>
