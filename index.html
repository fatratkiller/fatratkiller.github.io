    <p>With the development of Layer 2 and Rollups, Ethereum&rsquo;s ecosystem is shifting towards modular architecture. One of the biggest obstacles to the mass adoption of blockchain technology is scalability. Layer 1 scaling solutions focus on block production rather than block verification. Modular blockchain infrastructure aims to promote the adoption of Web3 with scalability, security, and decentralization features, and focuses on easy integration, rapid delivery, and user experience. Modular blockchains are becoming the most discussed topic, where modularization means dividing the consensus layer, data availability layer (DA), settlement layer, transaction execution layer, etc.</p>

In Summary:
- Three basic features of decentralized social networks include freedom from centralized control, decentralized data storage, and censorship resistance. - The channel model is replacing the traditional square model as a new paradigm of social networking. The channel model is behavior-oriented where users broadcast their messages to the whole network without necessary direct interaction with other users and influence on the network converges without causing a monopoly. - The ideal decentralized social networks should balance censorship and anticensorship and follow the principle of voluntarism and supermanism.</p>

    <p>Introduction: The growth of the DeFi sector is crucial for the development of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. However, there are still challenges in the design, implementation, and maintenance of DeFi exchanges, liquidity pools, and smart contracts. To address these challenges, artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been widely applied in the DeFi ecosystem. Market competition and changes
Defining the concepts of AIGC and DeFi
AIGC (AI Generated Content) refers to content generated by artificial intelligence, and as the technology continues to evolve, the application of AIGC becomes more and more widespread.</p>

    <p>https://www.bing-ventures.com/insights/46-Algorithmic-Stablecoins-Will-They-Ever-Find-Enough-Support- Algorithmic stablecoins, as their name implies, are cryptocurrencies that use algorithms to maintain a stable value instead of being backed up by any sort of reserve asset as collateral. However, in reality, some algorithmic stablecoins have struggled to maintain a stable peg, while others have failed catastrophically. This article examines the major types of algorithmic stablecoins, their design, and shortcomings and then explores how algorithmic stablecoins may develop over time.</p>

    <p>Block space is paramount for cryptocurrencies, especially major coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Although Ethereum is accolated by fans in the community for becoming a deflationary cryptocurrency with its recent changes, usability will matter the most in the long run. For Ethereum to succeed, it will need to continuously scale and optimize user experience. While containing fees below reasonable levels is necessary, scaling the Ethereum blockchain at a faster speed will be the goal.</p>

    <p>As early as 2016, the first decentralized governance scheme called &ldquo;TheDAO&rdquo; appeared on Ethereum to coordinate investment and governance in theDAO treasury. The history of DAO is also officially opened at this moment. Of course, the development of the first DAO is not smooth. The DAO’s treasury was hacked and lost funds, which later even led to the hard fork of Ethereum. However, the development of DAO has entered a new development since then.</p>

Users enjoy personalised services provided by big data, which brings great convenience to life, but the information collected includes sensitive information such as identity, hobbies, geographical location, and personal income. Once this personal privacy information is leaked, it will bring great security risks. Therefore, the emergence of privacy computing technology provides a solution for user data security. Privacy Computing refers to a comprehensive technology that realises the separation of data privacy and usability through confidential technologies such as federated learning, secure multi-party, homomorphic encryption, and zero-knowledge proof.</p>

    <p>Digital fashion enables internet users to express themselves without physical constraints. From digital physical products to fully immersive virtual content, the field is booming. As the virtual economy develops, we expect the industry to continue to grow.
Digital fashion has fundamentally changed the way we think about virtual identities. As more and more of our interactions take place in social media, games, and virtual worlds, our online identities will become a social marker of how others perceive us.</p>

    <p>Modular public chain is gradually becoming the most discussed topic, and the so-called modularity is to divide the consensus layer, data availability layer (DA), settlement layer, transaction execution layer, etc. into different chains, rather than one chain to handle all modules. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the fastest modular implementation layer, Fuel. The modular public chain is designed to divide the system into multiple module components, so that it has the characteristics of blockchain, and can even have sub-functions such as DEX application chain, stablecoin application chain, NFT application chain and derivative application chain.</p>

    <p>According to the Book of Genesis, Noah&rsquo;s descendants built a magnificent city near Babylon. They also built a tower of Babel to make a name for themselves. God was offended by the arrogance of man and decided to make a confusion of tongues so that they could not speak to one another. There is no mention in Genesis of whether God destroyed the tower, but in many deductive versions God did so.</p>
