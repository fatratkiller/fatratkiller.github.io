      <div class="content"><p>The lifeline of the asset management agreement is determined by its overhead. For the Protocol to be sustainable in the long term, DeSyn Protocol needs to obtain sustainable fees from user adoption. Has the DeSyn Protocol done enough to ensure its success? To answer this question, we need to fully understand how the DeSyn Protocol has evolved. This article will describe the state of DeSyn Protocol mobility and the reasons for promoting the use of this asset management Protocol.</p>
<p>Advantages of DeSyn Protocol</p>
<p>The advantages of the Web3 space are endless, and the same applies to the DeSyn protocol. DeSyn Protocol implements asset management in a user-run and executed manner. The first thing to note about DeSyn is that it has a low barrier to entry for investors, which in turn encourages global user participation. Investors are increasingly getting involved in projects where there are no barriers. DeSyn has put in place mechanisms to ensure that ordinary investors are involved.
Beyond that, DeSyn&rsquo;s other hallmark is its on-chain assets, the shared infrastructure. Users of the platform are not just traders, they are also creators and auditors. Users of the platform can audit the code on the blockchain, and they can also create and design their own features and rules, as DeSyn empowers users and becomes an incentive to become a contributor to the platform.
The Web3 asset management structure lies in its decentralized system. This decentralization encourages users to become part of the system by contributing to it. Web3 enables users to participate and share in the cumulative benefits. As a result, users involved in creating and designing asset management products will be more involved in benefit sharing. As a Web3 infrastructure platform, DeSyn will play more of a role in the future, attracting more financial systems keen on decentralization.</p>
<p>Simple user experience</p>
<p>A criticism of Web3 is the complexity and difficulty of its use. Fortunately, the unfriendly user experience of cross-chain asset swaps is overridden by the cross-chain trading route provided by DeSyn. DeSyn is greatly expanding its trading volume by integrating with other agreements, aiming to become an asset management service provider for current and future agreements. But DeSyn also needs favorable market conditions and faster roadmap execution. It must stay relevant in the yield-rich DeFi market and attract new users with their organic revenues.
These are crucial for DeSyn to achieve sustainable growth with relatively little risk:</p>
<ol>
<li>High security: The core of asset management projects is security. DeSyn&rsquo;s core code is verified and audited security code with fairly reliable security standards.</li>
<li>Support for multiple token payments: DeSyn should further expand its asset options.</li>
<li>High compatibility with multiple account addresses: Compatibility with many account addresses means more user sources, such as hardware wallet, Metamask, etc. Users can manually specify the number of owners and the address of their owner account, enabling easy deployment Settings.</li>
<li>High interaction with DApp: DeSyn can easily interact with many DeFi protocols, making it easy for users to invest, trade and manage digital assets. Beyond that, it should expand the ERC-721 token, support the ENS domain name and various other digital assets and more.
In short, DeSyn, as a digital asset management tool, attaches great importance to the security of its products and the convenience of users. This will also be a big advantage for its development.</li>
</ol>
<p>The future of decentralized capital management</p>
<p>All transactions, cash flows, underlying assets, contract documents and other data of DeSyn Protocol are linked up, and transaction participants are authorized to track and check at any time, so as to prevent black box trading process and let investors know exactly where their money is going. In the future, only through the construction of decentralized asset management ecology, can investors, third-party service agencies and external risk control agencies pay attention to the essence of the project, and bind the interests of investors and external service agencies in the process of asset linking and issuance, can DeSyn Protocol jointly pay attention to the long-term development of the project.
DeSyn Protocol is one of the more complex decentralized asset management system, which needs to be done by intelligent contract account management, demand match, fund settlement, income distribution, and other functions, platform attached to a port link layer using the API of a risk control mechanism, the third party appraisal institution, OTC borrowing funds services, brokerage services, service providers, etc., Investment rights, management rights and risk control rights are reasonably distributed and balanced, so as to finally realize the binding of interests between service providers and investors and jointly promote the healthy development of platform ecology.
If DeSyn Protocol completes tokenization of all creditor&rsquo;s rights assets, fixed assets and equity assets in the future and can be traded on the platform, then the change of the net value of assets will smooth out the fluctuations caused by asset risks. Assuming that the future market is equally likely to rise or fall, we don&rsquo;t make any directional judgments about the future market, which means that the crypto market is a zero-sum game. Any money earned by anyone must be paid by the counterparty. At this time, the two sides are competing for expertise, industry experience, teamwork, systems tools, security risk control, etc. In the more immature and rapidly developing crypto financial market, the value of DeSyn Protocol&rsquo;s brand and the professional ability of fund managers stands out. The characteristics of crypto assets determine that actively managed crypto funds such as DeSyn Protocol are the mainstream direction of the future.</p>
