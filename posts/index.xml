      <description>Warren Buffett&amp;rsquo;s longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, has continued to express his distrust of cryptocurrencies in media interviews. He called the &amp;ldquo;crypto craze&amp;rdquo; a &amp;ldquo;massive act of stupidity.&amp;rdquo; He described cryptocurrency as &amp;ldquo;like an open sewer full of evil creatures&amp;rdquo; and hoped investors would never touch or buy it. I can well understand the source of this sentiment and believe that his claim is valid.

This is mainly due to the so-called &amp;ldquo;blockchain triangle dilemma&amp;rdquo; - the inability to achieve a harmonious balance between scalability, decentralization and security. Yet, there is no denying that Ethereum currently has the strongest and most active ecosystem and also the highest adoption rate to date. SKALE is built on top of Ethereum, but it is much more than that.</description>

      <description>Synthetix (SNX): In 2022, Synthetix was considered a leader in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, with a strong focus on governance and decentralization. The project had plans to transition to a DAO structure and address inefficiencies within its governance system. The goal was to empower the community and ensure a smoother transition to full decentralization.&#xA;Current Status (January 2024): Synthetix has indeed made progress in its journey towards decentralization. The creation of multiple DAOs was an attempt to distribute power more evenly among the community members.</description>
