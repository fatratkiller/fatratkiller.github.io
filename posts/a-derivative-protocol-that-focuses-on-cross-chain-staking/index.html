      <div class="content"><p>With the success of Ethereum&rsquo;s Merge, Staking is Staking in a POS network from POW to POS, and Staking is Staking in a POS network, where Staking is Staking in the security of the network by Staking a token in the network. However, an asset that is otherwise locked cannot be used within a certain period of time. However, a derivative Staking frees up the liquidity of an asset, boosting its utilization. This article is Staking out the Bifrost about focused Staking, and how they Staking out an economy that is Staking in a multi-chain future.
A bold Staking derivative
Bifrost is a Web 3.0 infrastructure that provides cross-chain mobility for Staking, providing a decentralized, cross-chain Liquid Staking service for multiple chains using the Cross-Chain Communication Protocol (XCMP). Bifrost&rsquo;s mission is to converge more than 80% of the PoS consensus chain with cross-chain derivatives, provide standardized cross-chain interest-free derivatives for poca relay chains, parallel chains, and heterogeneous public chains bristle with Poca. Lower the threshold for user Staking, increase the proportion of multi-chain pledge, increase the revenue base of ecological applications, and build a StakeFi enabling environment that stakestaking, stakestaking, and StakeFi positively cycling
In fact, Staking a derivative is essentially Staking the native token that is participating in the Staking, so that if you hold that certificate, then you will get the benefit of it, and that certificate will be rigid enough to accept the native token back when the period is over. Staking derivatives address three main issues. The first problem is that under PoS consensus, the DeFi benefit and the Staking benefit conflict. The second issue is cross-chain cost. The third problem is the conflict between security and liquidity under the PoS consensus.
Staking derivative with great potential
The first is Staking Staking Staking Staking Staking Staking the chance of a racetrack. It will exist as an indispensable middleware that will capture value from the underlying chain, and from other applications on top. Staking will be more valuable when a Pos network is developed. For example, the largest Lido in Ethereum 2.0, with the success of Ethereum Merge, the market value of Lido also ushered in a recent high.
The second is for the user&rsquo;s chance, Staking derivatives open up new DeFi gameplay to the user. One example is arbitrage opportunities in derivatives. If there is a discount on the derivative, it is more profitable for a long-term holder to buy the derivative than to buy the spot. He can buy derivatives and redeem the original asset at a 1:1 rate, so the discount is actually an arbitrage space with low risk and high return. In other words, if users are more proficient in the mechanism of derivatives themselves, they will have the opportunity to earn higher profits in the ecology.
The third is that Staking derivatives give an ecological DeFi yield advantage, for the entire Poca ecological DeFi development. If all Staking in the future of Poca is DeFi with derivatives, then because of the underlying rate of interest, the DeFi rate in combination with Staking will be higher than that of ordinary DeFi, regardless of project subsidies. An Ethereum header DeFi project, for example, would be good if it is Staking more than 5% in the long run, but if you combine DeFi with a derivative, 5% interest and 15% Staking, then the DeFi product will be Staking 20% in the long run at an annual rate. To attract more users to the ecosystem.
Thriving Bifrost future
Poca, as a public chain of multi-chain ecology, has greater expansion space and potential compared with Ethereum in DeFi composability and interoperability. This is largely due to the fact that there are more scenarios on Poca that require incentives, such as Bifrost&rsquo;s Staking derivative track. DeFi items related to Staking derivatives promote mobility, and more liquidity is needed. Given the intense competition, it is natural to motivate users with more activities and higher APY.
In addition, the composability of cross-chain assets is not only reflected in application scenarios, but also in deep operability. The product form of centralized finance is very diverse, which is due to the recognition of unified value standard. When multi-chain solves the technical limitations, the value consensus of the major blockchains will tend to be more decentralized in nature. Under this premise, the gameplay and application of cross-chain assets will not only be determined by the project party and the public chain, but users will have higher freedom, stronger operability and greater sovereignty when using cross-chain assets in each smart contract and consensus mechanism. This is the future Bifrost is looking forward to, and a multi-chain future for users and communities that truly &ldquo;Web3&rdquo;.
Conclusion
Bifrost&rsquo;s multi-chain ambition has long been evident. Vtokens in its products can be circulated between major parallel chains, with rich application scenarios and unlimited investment potential. With the advent of XCM, parallel chains are just the first step. In the future, more chains will be connected and Vtokens will have more diverse ways to play. Other cross-chain assets in Poca Staking could be used to pair with the derivative of the native Token, presumably generating more incentive to boost liquidity. I believe that with the passage of time, Bifrost will usher in a new outbreak.</p>
